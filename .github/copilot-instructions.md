- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created. ✓ Created

- [x] Clarify Project Requirements ✓ Python-based heating monitoring system with DS18B20 sensors, DHT22, InfluxDB, and Grafana
	<!-- Ask for project type, language, and frameworks if not specified. Skip if already provided. -->

- [x] Scaffold the Project ✓ Heating monitoring system structure created with specialized sensors and analysis modules
	<!--
	Ensure that the previous step has been marked as completed.
	Call project setup tool with projectType parameter.
	Run scaffolding command to create project files and folders.
	Use '.' as the working directory.
	If no appropriate projectType is available, search documentation using available tools.
	Otherwise, create the project structure manually using available file creation tools.
	-->

- [x] Customize the Project ✓ Heating-specific sensor logic, InfluxDB client, and configuration system implemented
	<!--
	Verify that all previous steps have been completed successfully and you have marked the step as completed.
	Develop a plan to modify codebase according to user requirements.
	Apply modifications using appropriate tools and user-provided references.
	Skip this step for "Hello World" projects.
	-->

- [x] Install Required Extensions ✓ No specific extensions required for Python heating monitoring project
